A function $f$ of the complex variable $z$ is analytic in an open set $S$ if it has a derivative everywhere in that set. It is analytic at a point $z_0$ if it is analytic on some neighborhood of $z_0$. If $f$ is analytic at a point $z_0$, it must be analytic at each point in some neighborhood of $z_0$. 

If the set $S$ is not opened and $f$ is said to be analytic on it then it is to be understood that $f$ is analytic in an open set containing S.

Consider an open set $D$

* It follows that every polynomial is an [[entire]] function
* Sufficient conditions for analyticity in $D$ is provided by the [[sufficient conditions for differentiability]] theorems for [[polar coordinates]] as well.
* If two fucntions are analytic in a domain $D$, their sum and their product are both analytic in $D$. Similarly, their quotients is analytic in $D$ provided the fucntion in the denominator does not vanish at any point in $D$.
* The composition of two analytic functions is analytic and the derivative is just the chain rule: $$\frac{d}{dz}g[f(z)] = g'[f(z)]f'(z)$$

#### Theorem
If $f'(z) = 0$ everywhere in the domain $D$, then $f(z)$ must be constant throughout $D$.

If a funciton $f$ fails to be analytic at a point $z_0$ but is analytic at some point in every neighborhood of $z_0$, the $z_0$ is called a [[singular points]],  or singularity, of f.
