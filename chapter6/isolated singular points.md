If a function fails to be [[analytic]] on the interior of a [[simply connected domain]] then we get a specific number called a residue.

A [[singular points]] $z_0$ is said to be isolated if there is a deleted $\epsilon$ neighborhood $0<\vert z-z_0\vert < \epsilon$ of $z_0$ throughout which $f$ is [[analytic]].
