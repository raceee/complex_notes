When $z_0$ is an [[isolated singular points]] of a function $f$, there is a positive number $R_2$ such that $f$ is [[analytic]] at each point $z$ for which $0<\vert z - z_0\vert < R_2$.

The function $f$ evaluated at $f(z)$ can be represtented by a Laurent series:
$$f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n (z-z_0 )^n + \frac{b_1}{(z - z_0)}+ \frac{b_2}{(z - z_0)^2}+\dots + \frac{b_n}{(z - z_0)^n}+\dots$$

The complex number $b_1$, which is the coefficient of $1/(z - z_0)$ in the laurent expansion is called the residue of $f$ at the isolated singular point $z_0$, and we shall often write $$b_1 = Res_{z=z_0}f(z)$$
