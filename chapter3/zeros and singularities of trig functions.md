A zero of a given function $f$ is a number $z_0$ such that $f(z_0 ) = 0$. It is possible that a function of a real variable can have more zeros when the domain of definition is enlarged.
## Theorem 
The zeros of $\sin z$ and $\cos z$ in the complex plane are the same as the zeros of $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ on the real line. That is, $$\sin z = 0\quad iff\quad z = n\pi$$and $$\cos z = 0 \quad iff\quad z = \frac{\pi}{2}+n\pi$$
