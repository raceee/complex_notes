Consider $$e^w = z$$ Where $w$ is a non zero complex number. Note that $z = re^{i\Theta}$ where $-\pi < \Theta \leq \pi$ and $w = u +iv$, in this case $e^w = z$ becomes $$e^u e^{iv} = re^{i\Theta}$$ 


Thus $$e^u = r \quad\quad v = \Theta + 2n\pi$$ Since $e^u = r$ then $u = \ln r$.
Ultimately th equations for a $\log$ function are 
$$\log z = \ln\vert z\vert + i\arg z$$
$$\log z = \ln r + i(\Theta + 2n\pi )$$ 

The [[principal value]] of $\log z$ is the value obtained when $n=0$ in the previous equation.
