Consider $$e^w = z$$ Where $w$ is a non zero complex number. Note that $z = re^{i\Theta}$ where $-\pi < \Theta \leq \pi$ and $w = u +iv$, in this case $e^w = z$ becomes $$e^u e^{iv} = re^{i\Theta}$$ Thus $$e^u = r \quad\quad v = \Theta + 2n\pi$$ Since $e^u = r$ then $u = \ln r$. From regular algebra with logarithms then we result $$w = \ln r + i(\Theta + 2n\pi)$$and $$\log z = \ln r + i(\Theta + 2n\pi )$$ Finally leaving us with the multiple valued function $$e^{\log z} = z$$and $$e^{\ln x} = x$$ Which should look familiar.
