When $z\neq 0$ and the exponnet $c$ is any complex number, the power function $z^c$ is defined by means of the equation $$z^c = e^{clog z}, \quad z\neq 0$$ Because of the [[logarithm function]], $z^c$ is, in general, multiple-valued. $$\frac{1}{z^c} = \frac{1}{exp(c\log z)} = exp(-c\log z) = z^{-c}$$ When s specific [[branch]] $$\log z = \ln r + i\theta \quad r > 0, \alpha < \theta < \alpha + 2\pi$$ of the logarithmic function is used, $\log z$ is single-valued and analytic in the indicated domain. When that branch is used, the function (1) is single-valued and [[analytic]] in the same domain. The derivative of the [[branch]] of $z^c$ is found by first using the chain rule to write $$\frac{d}{dz}z^{c} = \frac{d}{dz}exp(c\log z) = \frac{c}{z}exp(c\log z)$$ recalling the identity of the [[logarithm function]] $z = exp(\log z)$ yields $$\frac{d}{dz}z^c = c\frac{exp(c\log z)}{exp(\log z)} = c\exp [(c-1)\log z] = \frac{d}{dz}z^c = cz^{c-1}$$ The [[principal value]] of $z^{c}$ occurs when $\log z$ is replaced by $Log z$ such that $$P.v. z^c = e^{cLog z}$$ Exponential functions with base $c$ are as follows $$c^z = e^{z\log c}$$ where $$\frac{d}{dz}c^z = c^z \log c$$

# Examples
1. The power function $$i^i = e^{i\log i}$$ Inasmuch as $$\log i = \ln 1 + i(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2n\pi ) = \left(2n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\pi i$$ we are able to write $$i^i = exp\left[ i\left( 2n +\frac{1}{2}\right) \pi i\right] = exp\left[ -\left( 2n +\frac{1}{2}\right) \pi\right]$$ $$P.V. i^i = \exp\left( -\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$$ Note that the values of $i^i$ are all real numbers.
2. The principal [[branch]] of $z^{2/3}$ can be written $$\exp \left( \frac{2}{3}Log z\right) = \exp\left(\frac{2}{3}\ln r + \frac{2}{3}i\Theta\right) = {}^3\sqrt{r^2}\exp\left(i\frac{2\Theta}{3} \right)$$ Thus $$P.V.z^{2/3} = {}^3\sqrt{r^2}\cos\frac{2\Theta}{3} + i{}^3\sqrt{r^2}\sin\frac{2\Theta}{3}$$
