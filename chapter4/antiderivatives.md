##### Theorem 
Suppose that a function $f(z)$ is continuous in a domain D. If any one of the following statements is true, then so are the others:
1. $f(z)$ has an antiderivative $F(z)$ throughout $D$;
2. The integrals of $f(z)$ along contours lying entirely in $D$ and extending from an fixed point $z_1$ to any fixed point $z_2$ all have the same value, namely $$\int_{z_1}^{z_2}f(z)dz = \left[ F(z)\right]_{z_1}^{z^2} = F(z_2 ) - F(z_1)$$
3. the integrals of $f(z)$ around closed contours lying entirely in $D$ all have value zero.
