Consider the complex valued function where $t$ is real $$\omega(t) = u(t) + iv(t)$$ Where $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ are the real and complex portions of the functions respectively. Then $$\omega'(t) = u'(t) + iv'(t)$$ Now let $z_0 = x_0 + iy_0$ and consider $$\frac{d}{dt}z_0\omega(t) = \frac{d}{dt} (x_0 +iy_0)(u(t) + iv(t))$$ After foiling the complex number with the real and imaginary parts of $\omega(t)$ we get $$\frac{d}{dt}z_0\omega(t) =z_0\omega'(t)$$

Mean value theorem $$\omega'(c) = \frac{w(b) - w(a)}{b-a}$$ does not hold anymore
