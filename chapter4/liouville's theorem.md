Cauchy's inequality in [[cauchy integral formula]] can be used to show that no [[entire]]function except a constant is bounded in the complex plane. Our first theorem here, which is known as Liouville's theorem, staes this result in a slightly different way

#### Theorem 1
If a function $f$ is entire and bounded in the complex plane, then $f(z)$ is constant throughout the plane.

#### Theorem 2
Any polynomial $$P(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 +\dots + a_n z^n \quad (a_n\neq0)$$ of degree $n (n\geq 1)$ has at least one zero. That is, there exists at least one point $z_0$ such that $P(z_0 ) = 0$.
