A domain that is not simply connected is said to be multiply connected.

#### Theorem
Suppose that
1. C is a simple closed contour, described in the counterclockwise direction;
2. $C_k$ ($k = 1,2,\dots , n$) are simple closed contours interior to $C$, all described in the clockwise direction, that are disjoint and whose interiors have no points in common. If a function $f$ is analytic on all of these contours and throughout the mulitioly connected domain consisting of the points inside $C$ and exterior to each $C_k$, then $$\int_{C}f(z)dz + \sum_{k=1}^{n}\int_{C_k}f(z)dz = 0$$

##### Corollary
Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ denote positively oriented simple closed [[contour]]s, where $C_1$ is interior to $C_2$. If a fucntion $f$ is analytic in the closed region consisiting of those contours and all points between them, then $$\int_{C_1}f(z)dz = \int_{C_2}f(z)dz$$ this corollary is known as the principle of deformation of paths since it tells us that if $C_1$ is continuously deformed into $C_2$, always passing through points at which $f$ is [[analytic]], then the value of $f$ over $C_1$ never changes.
