##### Lemma
Suppose that $\vert f(z)\vert \leq \vert f(z_0 )\vert$ at each point $z$ in some neighborhood $\vert z- z_0\vert < \epsilon$ in which $f$ is analytic. Then $f(z)$ has the constant value $f(z_0 )$ throughout that neighborhood.

#### Theorem 
If a function $f$ is analytic and not constant in a given domain $D$, then $\vert f(z)\vert$ has no maximum value in $D$. That is, there is no point $z_0$ in the domain such that $\vert f(z)\vert \leq \vert f(z_0) \vert$ for all points $z$ in it.

##### Corollary
 Suppose that a function $f$ is continuous on a closed bounded region $R$ and that it is [[analytic]] and not constant in the interior of $R$. Then the maximum value of $\vert f(z)\vert$ in $R$, which is always reached, occurs somewhere on the boundary of $R$ and never in the interior.
