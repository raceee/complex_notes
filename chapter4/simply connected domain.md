A simply connected domain $D$ is a domain such that every simple closed contour within it encloses only points of $D$.

---

#### Theorem 
If a function $f$ is [[analytic]] throughout a [[simply connected domain]] $D$, then $$\int_{C}f(z)dz = 0$$ for every closed [[contour]] $C$ lying in $D$.

---

##### Corollary 1
A function $f$ that is [[analytic]] throughout a [[simply connected domain]] $D$ must have an antiderivative everywhere in $D$.

---

##### Corollary 2
[[Entire]] functions always possess [[antiderivatives]]
